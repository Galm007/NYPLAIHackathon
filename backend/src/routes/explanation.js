 * THE SLOW PATH. The frontend calls this only when /api/score came back with
 * `explanationSource: "template"`, then swaps the text in place. Synchronous —
 * the client waits on this one call, no polling. That is a deliberate hackathon
 * simplification, and it is what keeps the AI latency off the score request.
 *
 * Always 200 with a usable explanation. If the AI call fails, the response
 * carries the template text and `explanationSource: "template"` — the frontend
 * simply has nothing to swap, and the user never sees an error.
